# a-text-adventure
Just a regular text adventure game.

All poor coding practices in the interpreter are part of the joke.

Run the program with `0` as the first argument to play the game. Alternatively, you can write a set of instructions
to `instructions.txt` in advance, and run the game on them by supplying anything else as the first argument.
`instructions.txt` may contain the word `loop` on one line; once all instructions before the `loop` have been
executed, all instructions after it will be executed in a loop until the game ends.

Have "fun" building a Turing machine inside the game.
